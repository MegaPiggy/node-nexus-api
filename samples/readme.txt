Each file in this directory contains one sample request
and the expected output.

If you're using the VS Code extension "REST Client" by Huachao Mao
you can test the requests immediately through the extension (
not at the time of writing because it doesn't support user-set
variables yet) and generate sample code for various programming
languages.
